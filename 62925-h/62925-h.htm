<p>You no doubt have many reasons for your choice
of this car. All of them, we are sure, are good reasons.
Accept our congratulations and thanks on your
purchase of a fine motor car.</p>
<p>Speaking of reasons, we have three for printing this
book. First, to tell you <i>what you have</i> in your car. Second,
to tell you <i>how to operate it</i>. Third, to tell you
what care it should receive to serve you best.</p>
<p>For more technical information as to how your
car or any of its parts operates or how to make any
of a multitude of adjustments or repairs, we refer
you to your Studebaker dealer. Studebaker owners
operate their cars with the assurance of a friendly,
nation-wide service organization. Dealers&rsquo; men are
constantly informed by us of the latest advances in
technical procedures, tools, and equipment.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INSTRUMENTS AND CONTROLS</span></h2>
<p><i>The driver of a new car should become familiar with
the functions of the instruments and controls described
below before operating the car. Standard equipment
varies to some extent between different models. The illustration
above includes both standard and
extra equipment.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Ignition Switch</b></i> The ignition switch is operated by
means of a key which, when turned to the right, supplies
current to the ignition system and accessories. Turned to
the left, the key completes the electrical circuit to the
gasoline gage, radio, and other accessories but not to the
ignition. <i>The ignition key should always be removed
when you leave the car.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Starter Switch</b></i> The starter is controlled by a button
on the toeboard located directly beneath the clutch
pedal. By completely depressing the clutch pedal, the
electrical circuit through the starter switch is completed.
Do not operate starter when the engine is running.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Ammeter</b></i> When the engine is not running and any
of the electrical circuits are in use, the ammeter will register
a discharge (-). With the engine running at a reasonable
speed, even though all electrical circuits are in
use, the ammeter will register a charge (+) until the
battery is completely charged, after which the needle
should swing back and remain around the zero mark.
Any abnormal fluctuation of the ammeter needle in either
direction is a signal to the driver to have the electrical
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
system checked and serviced by his authorized Studebaker
dealer.</p>
<div class="img">

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>HEADLIGHT BEAM CONTROL</dt>
<dt>CLUTCH</dt>
<dt>BRAKE</dt>
<dt>STARTER BUTTON</dt>
<dt>ACCELERATOR PEDAL</dt></dl>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Heat Indicator</b></i> The temperature of the coolant in
the engine cooling system is shown by the electric heat indicator
which, under normal conditions, should register
within the rectangular mark on the face of the gage.
In summer, and on hot, long drives this may normally
be a little higher.</p>
<p>If the gage registers an abrupt or continuous rise to
the &ldquo;H&rdquo; mark, stop the car immediately and investigate.
Check the water level, fan belt, hose connections, and
look for water leaks. Continued use at this temperature
will cause serious damage and unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>The gage registers only when the ignition key is
turned either to the right or left.</p>
<p>Check the water level frequently.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Gasoline Gage</b></i> The gasoline gage registers when
the ignition key is turned either to the right or left. If
you wish to know the quantity of fuel in the tank when
the engine is not running, turn the ignition key to the
left. It takes about 30 seconds for the gage to register
after the ignition key is turned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Oil Pressure Gage</b></i> The oil pressure gage indicates
the working pressure of the oil as it circulates within the
engine. Normally, the gage will register between 20 and
40 pounds (1,4 and 2,8 kgs.) at 40 miles (64 km.) per
hour. <i>This gage does not indicate the amount of oil in
the crankcase.</i></p>
<p>If this gage should fluctuate rapidly or drop to zero,
STOP the car immediately and check the cause. Continued
operation of the car under these conditions will probably
cause serious damage.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Locks and Keys</b></i> Two sets of keys are furnished
with the car. One key operates the front door external
locks and the ignition switch. The other key operates
locks on the package compartment door (except Champion
Custom) and the luggage compartment lid.</p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized persons from purchasing a
duplicate ignition key, the key number does not appear
on the key or on the face of the lock, but is stamped on a
small metal tag supplied with the keys. The compartment
key number is stamped on the key or on the lock
housing. Both key numbers should be recorded on <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>
of this manual and elsewhere among the owner&rsquo;s permanent
possessions, after which the metal tag should be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Duplicate keys may be ordered by key number from
the nearest authorized Studebaker dealer. If the key
numbers are not known, the order must be accompanied
by the car serial number.</p>
<p>Front door lock controls are designed so that either
front door, locked from the inside, may be opened from
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the outside with the key. This is an advantage in parking
lots when close parking blocks one door.</p>
<p>If an inside front door handle is set to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; position
with the door open and the door is then closed, the lock
releases; Studebaker front doors must be key-locked in
such circumstances. The key will always unlock either of
the front doors from the outside no matter whether it
has been locked from the inside with the door lock control
or locked from the outside with the key.</p>
<p>The next three paragraphs explain the operation of
the door locks.</p>
<p class="revint">1. Front door inside handles, when pushed up from
the normal position to lock the door from the inside,
will spring back to the normal position although
the lock will remain set.</p>
<p class="revint">2. The front doors are locked from the outside with
the key. Turn the key to the stop clockwise on left
front doors and counterclockwise on right front
doors. Return the key to the vertical position to remove
it from the lock. To unlock the front doors
follow the same procedure except turn the key to
the stop in the opposite direction to that used to
lock the door.</p>
<p class="revint">3. To lock either rear door of sedans, simply move
the inside door handle upward, whether the door is
open or closed. The door will remain locked until
the inside rear door handle is moved downward to
the full open position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Hood Lock</b></i> The hood lock safeguards your battery,
carburetor, and other under-the-hood equipment against
theft and tampering as long as the car doors are locked.
The hood control (marked &ldquo;H&rdquo;) is located on the driver&rsquo;s
side of the car just below the lower end of the instrument
panel. To unlock the hood, pull the control until
the automatic hood lock is released. To raise the hood,
release the safety latch as illustrated. As a safety measure,
after raising the hood, remove the end of the hood prop
from its bracket and place it in the hole provided on the
underside of the hood at the front.</p>
<p>Care should always be taken in raising or lowering
the hood. Never try to force the hood lock or safety
latch. This might affect adjustments which would result
in an improperly operating part.</p>
<p>Lower the hood firmly so that the automatic hood latch
and the safety latch are fastened securely.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>Headlights and Tail Lights</b></i> Pull the light switch
control as far out as possible (second position) to operate
the headlights and tail lights.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Headlight Beam Control Switch</b></i> The foot-operated
switch to the left of the clutch pedal operates the
headlight beam. Pressing down on the switch will change
the headlights from country to traffic beam, and vice
versa as traffic conditions require. When the country
beam is in use the red tell-tale light in the speedometer
face will be lighted. Use the traffic beam when approaching
oncoming traffic and in city driving.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Instrument and Map Lights</b></i> The instruments are
lighted with non-glare <i>black light</i>. Turn the control
clockwise for instrument lights.</p>
<p>In Deluxe and Regal models a map light can be
lighted by turning the control counterclockwise. On
these models, this light will also operate whenever either
of the front doors is open.</p>
<p><i><b>Dome Light</b></i> The dome light in all models is operated
by a switch just to the rear of the right front door.
On Deluxe and Regal models, this light operates on
2-door bodies when either front door is open and on
4-door bodies when either rear door is open.</p>
<p>There is no dome light in convertible models.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p class="tb"><i><b>License Plate Light</b></i> The light for the rear license
plate is located in the center of the luggage compartment
handle. The light operates whenever the headlights are
turned on.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Stop Lights</b></i> They light whenever the brake pedal
is depressed, making a distinct red light shine to warn
following vehicles.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Luggage Compartment Light</b></i> This light goes on
when tail lights are lighted and the luggage compartment
lid is open. <i>The luggage compartment light is
available at slight extra cost.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Package Compartment</b></i> To open the package
compartment door after unlocking, turn the rotary knob
to the right and open door. <i>An automatic package compartment
light is available at extra cost.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Ash Receiver</b></i> To remove the tray for cleaning, push
down on the retainer while pulling outward on the tray.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="600" height="256" />
</div>
<p><i><b>Front Seat Adjustment</b></i> The front seat is easily
adjusted forward or backward. Move the control lever
forward at the driver&rsquo;s side of the seat (as shown in the
illustration above). This unlocks the mechanism and permits
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
the seat to be shifted to the desired position.</p>
<p>In addition to this quickly adjusted shift, there are
three basic positions in which the seat can be bolted by
your authorized Studebaker dealer to accommodate the
leg length of the owner. From any of these basic positions,
the front seat adjustment mechanism will give you
the full adjustment range.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Clutch Pedal</b></i> The clutch pedal disengages the clutch
when depressed, engages it when released. The clutch
pedal, depressed to the floorboard, also operates the starter
button located directly under the pedal.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Steering Post Gearshift</b></i> The steering post gearshift
is operated in the conventional manner, and provides
three forward speeds and one reverse speed.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Luggage Compartment Lid and Lock</b></i> The luggage
compartment lid is controlled by a lock and handle
contained in the rear emblem incorporating the license
plate light and rear license plate bracket. The luggage
compartment lock is operated with the same key which
operates the package compartment lock.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>To close, lock and remove the key. Lower lid firmly
to be sure it has latched. The tight rubber weatherseals
have a spring action which will tend to hold lid in a
slightly raised position unless it is firmly closed.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Brake Controls</b></i> Braking pressure is applied to all
four wheels in proportion to the amount of foot pressure
applied to the brake pedal.</p>
<p>The parking brake lever operates independently of the
hydraulic brake system, applying brake pressure to the
rear wheels only. To set the parking brake, <i>depress brake
pedal and pull back on parking brake handle</i>. To release
the parking brake, depress brake pedal, pull back slightly
on the handle, press the release button with the thumb,
and let the handle move forward.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Windshield Wiper Control</b></i> The windshield wiper
control knob, located at the top center of the instrument
board, must be turned clockwise to operate the wiper
blades.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Windshield Washer</b></i> The Studebaker AC-2047
safety windshield washer is equipped with a control button
mounted on the dash just above and to the left of the
clutch pedal pad. To operate, exert a slight foot pressure
on the button, which will eject water to right and left
Windshields. An antifreeze and wetting agent is available
from your dealer for injection into the water supply jar.</p>
<p><i>Windshield Washers are available at extra cost.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Seat Cushion Auxiliary Springs</b></i> To vary the
front or rear seat cushion resiliency for the driver or
passengers, Select-O-Seat cushion springs are available
as an accessory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">RUN-IN PERIOD</span></h2>
<h3>The First 1000 Miles (1609 km.)</h3>
<p>It is desirable to limit driving speeds during the first
1000 miles (1609 km.) of operation in order that the
closely fitted parts of the engine and chassis may have
an opportunity to &ldquo;wear in&rdquo; smoothly.</p>
<p>For the <i>first 500 miles</i> (<i>805 km.</i>) it is recommended
that you do not drive your car at speeds in excess of <i>50
miles (80,5 km.) per hour</i>. For the <i>second 500 miles</i>
(<i>805 km.</i>) it is recommended that you do not drive your
car at speeds in excess of <i>60 miles (96,6 km.) per hour</i>.</p>
<p>While it is always better to let your engine warm up
at lower speeds, you should, by all means, follow such a
practice during the first 1000 miles (1609 km.) of operation.</p>
<p>Further, it is well to avoid <i>continuous</i> high speed
driving during the first 1000 miles (1609 km.) even
though the engine has been warmed up.</p>
<h3>Engine Oil During Run-In</h3>
<p>The use of special run-in oils is not necessary. Use
only engine oils produced by reputable oil companies.</p>
<p>During the run-in period it is important to change the
oil shortly after the engine is put into operation. Therefore,
change oil <i>at least</i> by the end of the first 1000 miles
(1609 km.). After 1000 miles (1609 km.), change oil
regularly. See <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>.</p>
<p>It is a good practice to have the oil level checked
whenever gasoline is purchased. Keep oil at the Full
mark. <i>Do not overfill.</i></p>
<p>The viscosity of the oil to be used depends entirely
upon prevailing temperatures. See <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">OPERATING THE CAR</span></h2>
<h3>Starting The Engine</h3>
<p>Before starting the engine be sure the gearshift lever
is in neutral position. Depress the accelerator to the
toeboard once only and then immediately release it. This
permits the automatic choke to come into full operation.
This operation is essential to easy starting. Turn the
ignition key to the right. Then depress the clutch pedal
to the toeboard to operate the starter.</p>
<p>If engine should not start after a few revolutions, completely
depress accelerator and, holding it in this position,
operate starter.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Starting a Hot Engine</b></i> It is easier to start a hot
engine if the accelerator is held approximately halfway
to the floorboard until the engine starts. Release the accelerator
as soon as the engine starts.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Warming Up the Engine</b></i> A gasoline engine performs
best when it reaches an operating temperature of
approximately 170&deg; F. (76,7&deg; C.). This is the normal
range indicated by the rectangular mark on the face of
the heat indicator. In cold weather the engine temperature
should be raised by allowing the engine to idle slowly
before driving the car.</p>
<p>Do not drive the car until oil pressure registers on the
gage. If it registers above 40 lbs. (2,8 kgs.), drive slowly
until pressure returns to normal, or approximately
40 lbs. (2,8 kgs.).</p>
<p>After starting, the high idle system may cause the engine
to &ldquo;race&rdquo;. If so, depress and immediately release
the accelerator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3>Push or Tow Starting</h3>
<p>Should the battery fail to supply enough current to
start the engine with the starter, place the transmission
in conventional high gear and either push or tow the
car until the engine starts. <i>OD control (on cars so
equipped) must be in Out position.</i> Be sure ignition is
On and parking brake released.</p>
<h3>Shifting the Gears</h3>
<p>To shift the gears in either the conventional or overdrive
ratios with the steering post gearshift lever, follow
this procedure:</p>
<h4>TO SET CAR INTO MOTION</h4>
<p class="revint">1. Start engine and with clutch pedal still depressed,
place gearshift lever in low (first) gear position.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Release parking brake.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Release the clutch pedal gradually and at the same
time slowly accelerate.</p>
<h4>TO SHIFT FROM LOW TO SECOND GEAR</h4>
<p class="revint">1. At approximately 10 miles (16 km.) per hour, release
accelerator and depress clutch pedal.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Place gearshift lever in second (intermediate) gear
position.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Release the clutch pedal gradually and at the same
time slowly accelerate.</p>
<h4>TO SHIFT INTO HIGH (THIRD) GEAR</h4>
<p class="revint">1. At approximately 18 miles (29 km.) per hour, release
accelerator and depress clutch pedal.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Shift lever into high (third) gear position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p class="revint">3. Release the clutch pedal gradually and at the same
time slowly accelerate. Without overdrive, this is
the highest or cruising gear ratio.</p>
<h4>TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE GEAR</h4>
<p class="revint">1. <i>Bring the car to a complete stop.</i></p>
<p class="revint">2. Depress clutch pedal.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Place lever in reverse gear position.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Release the clutch pedal gradually and at the same
time slowly accelerate.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Shifting Tips</b></i> To avoid excessive wear on the clutch,
transmission, and drive mechanism, never try to jump
gears (that is, do not shift from low to high, or start out
in second and avoid using low) and never shift from
any gear&mdash;even the neutral position&mdash;into reverse until
the car&rsquo;s motion is stopped. Also, never make a gear
shift until the clutch pedal is depressed, disengaging the
clutch. Make it a habit to pause for an instant in neutral
as the gearshift lever passes from one gear ratio to another.</p>
<h3>Transmission Overdrive</h3>
<p>The automatic overdrive operates only when the control
handle, next to the hood control handle and marked
OD, is in its full forward position. It engages automatically
when the accelerator is released momentarily
at or above the overdrive cut-in speed of 30 to 35 miles
(50 to 55 km.) per hour.</p>
<p>If, while in overdrive, it is desired to gain more power
for passing cars in traffic or on grades, push the accelerator
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
to the floorboard. This cuts out the overdrive
and it will remain inoperative until the accelerator is
again released. At that time the overdrive again engages
automatically.</p>
<p>The overdrive control can be pulled out, thereby locking
the transmission in the conventional position. This
should be done for descending steep, mountainous grades,
<i>or when pushing or towing the car to start the engine</i>.
The circumstances under which this change can be made
safely are as follows:</p>
<p class="revint">1. To change the transmission from overdrive to the
locked-in conventional position while the car is
standing still, merely pull out the OD control.</p>
<p class="revint">2. To change the transmission from overdrive to the
locked-in conventional position when driving below
the overdrive cut-in speed of approximately 30-35
m.p.h. (50-55 km.) accelerate the engine and at
the same time pull out the OD control.</p>
<p class="revint">3. To change the transmission from overdrive to the
locked-in conventional position when driving in
overdrive, completely depress the accelerator past
the wide-open throttle position and as soon as the
transmission is in conventional, pull out the OD
control.</p>
<p>If the OD control is in the locked-in conventional position
(pulled out) it can be placed in the overdrive position
while the car is standing still. To make this change
when the car is moving at any forward speed, accelerate
slightly and push the control fully forward.</p>
<p><i>Overdrive is available at extra cost.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3>Automatic Hill Holder</h3>
<p>The automatic Hill Holder retains the same degree
of braking effort on an upgrade as that applied by the
driver in stopping <i>as long as the clutch pedal is depressed</i>.
The Hill Holder does not operate on level or descending
surfaces. However, the clutch must be depressed before
releasing the brake pedal. This permits the right foot to
be removed from the brake pedal to operate the accelerator
when ready to resume forward motion. Releasing
the clutch pedal releases the action of the Hill
Holder.</p>
<p>To use the Hill Holder when stopping on an upgrade,
depress the clutch pedal and then apply foot brakes. The
right foot may now be removed from the brake pedal.
To release Hill Holder action, release the clutch pedal.</p>
<p><i>Hill Holder is special equipment for the Champion
available at extra cost.</i></p>
<h3>Studebaker Climatizer and Defroster</h3>
<p>The Studebaker Climatizer is a fresh air heating and
ventilating system. Fresh air passes through an air duct
and then through the Climatizer heater core. The warmed
air is discharged forward and rearward from below the
front seat and spreads uniformly through the car interior.</p>
<p>The Climatizer heat output is thermostatically controlled
so that you may select the degree of heating desired
and be assured of its remaining constant until you
reset the control. Pushing or pulling the control regulates
a thermostat which in turn controls the flow of water
through the heater coils. The further outward you pull
the control, the warmer will be the hot air output of the
Climatizer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>When the engine cooling water is cold and the control
is in the closed position, the thermostat permits a full
flow of water into the heat core until the temperature
at the thermostat unit (just above the accelerator pedal)
reaches approximately 70&deg; F. (21&deg; C.). As the water
gets warmer, the thermostat will maintain that temperature.
If you desire more heat in the car, pull the
Climatizer control. After using the Climatizer a few
times you will find the position of the control that
gives you the heat in the car which best suits your comfort.
Further regulation of the control will be unnecessary.</p>
<p>If you wish to obtain maximum heat flow in extremely
cold weather, pull the handle to its full &ldquo;out&rdquo; position.
This will lock the valve open until you push the handle
forward.</p>
<h3>Climatizer Operation</h3>
<p>The entire range of Climatizer and defroster operation
is controlled through the use of the Climatizer and

when pulled or pushed, operates blowers when
turned. The vent control opens and closes the right outside
cowl ventilator.</p>

<p class="revint">1. To open the outside right cowl ventilator, move the
control lever (directly beneath the package compartment)
to the left. This is the position of the ventilator
whenever you operate the Climatizer or want to
draw fresh outside air into the car through the
Climatizer system. To close the ventilator, move the
control lever to the right. When using Climatizer,
be sure the inner ventilator door is closed.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Pull Climatizer control handle outward to the position
which gives the temperature desired by the car
occupants. The further outward the control is
pulled, the warmer the air will become.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Turn the Climatizer control handle clockwise to the
first position to operate the Climatizer blower. Turning
the control to the second position clockwise will
continue the Climatizer blower operation and will
also add the operation of the defroster blower.</p>

<p class="revint">4. Slight opening of one or more ventilators or windows
permits some measure of directional control
over circulation since warm air flow will be increased
towards such openings. For uniform temperature
and defrosting efficiency throughout the
entire car, however, it is generally recommended
that windows and vents be fully closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p class="revint smaller">NOTE.&mdash;If upon entering a cold car, the accumulation of moisture
on windshield and windows appears excessive, open the ventilator
windows for rapid circulation until the moisture begins
to clear.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Defroster Operation</b></i> Turn the Climatizer control
counterclockwise to the first position for maximum
hot air flow through the defroster ducts; turn control
to the second position to reduce the defroster air flow.</p>
<p><i>Climatizer and defroster are special equipment available
at extra cost.</i></p>
<h3>Operation of the Convertible Top</h3>
<p>The mechanically operated top of the Studebaker convertible
models is raised and lowered by an electric motor
and prelubricated driving arms and gears. The mechanism
is controlled by a lever located at the left of the two
control handles at the lower edge of the instrument panel
on the driver&rsquo;s side of the car. Moving the lever to the
left raises the top, and to the right, lowers it. When the
lever is released from either of these positions, it automatically
returns to the central position, stopping the
electric motor.</p>
<p><i>Always let the motor operate the top&mdash;never try to
force the top up or down by hand.</i></p>
<h3>Top Operation Motor Circuit Breaker</h3>
<p>The electric motor is guarded against short circuit and
overload by a 30-ampere circuit breaker. Should a short
circuit or overload occur in the top operating system, the
circuit breaker will automatically interrupt the circuit
and will continue to interrupt it until the cause is
eliminated.</p>
<p>If the circuit breaker interrupts the current flow for
any reason, see your Studebaker dealer.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">LUBRICATION</span></h2>
<h3>Periodic Inspections</h3>
<p>It is good for reasons of economy and to forestall unexpected
need of service to have your car inspected once
a month or at 1000 mile (1609 km.) lubrication periods.
An ideal time to have many of the parts or units inspected
is while the car is on the lubrication hoist in the
raised position.</p>
<h3>Lubrication Operations</h3>
<p>Proper lubrication is good assurance that your car will
continue to perform with increasing satisfaction. Only
high quality lubricants should be used on your car.</p>
<p>Your Studebaker dealer knows every lubrication requirement
for your car. Take it to him for periodic lubrication.
The recommendations given in the following
paragraphs are, in many ways, the most important in the
entire booklet. If a lubrication service must, of necessity,
be performed by a non-Studebaker serviceman, be sure
he understands the requirements mentioned in this section
and on the charts on pages <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, 29, and 30.</p>
<p><i><b>Universal Joints</b></i> Lubricate with light weight chassis
lubricant at 1000 mile (1609 km.) intervals. Only a
low pressure (hand) gun should be used to lubricate
these bearings.</p>
<p><i><b>Transmission Lubricant</b></i> The transmission should
be filled to the level of the filler plug hole with S.A.E. 90
mineral oil gear lubricant or S.A.E. 40 engine oil, both
summer and winter. On cars equipped with overdrive
transmission, fill <i>slowly</i>, using the fill hole of the main
case. For transmission capacities, see table on <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>Rear Axle Lubricant</b></i> Use Studebaker hypoid lubricant
or any S.A.E. 90 hypoid lubricant (multi-purpose
type gear lubricant) for summer and winter. <i>Do not mix
various brands of hypoid lubricants.</i> Use light engine oil
for flushing. <i>Do not use kerosene.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Crankcase Oil Level</b></i> The oil in the crankcase is
checked by withdrawing the oil level gage on the left
side of the engine. The oil filler pipe cap contains a filtering
element to clean the air of any impurities before it
enters the crankcase. This filter is easily cleaned by removing
the cap and immersing it in kerosene. Allow
filter cap to dry thoroughly. Then dip cap in a good
grade of engine oil so that filtering element is thoroughly
oil coated. Drain off excess oil and replace cap. It&rsquo;s a
good idea to have the oil level checked when purchasing
gasoline.</p>
<p>Never allow oil level shown on oil level gage to fall
below the ADD OIL mark. DO NOT OVERFILL.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Engine Oil Filter</b></i> The Fram oil filter (on cars so
equipped) assists in removing dirt and foreign matter
from the oil and is provided with a replaceable filter
element.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions the Fram Filter cartridge
should be replaced after approximately every 5000 miles
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
(8046 km.) of operation. Severe dust conditions may
warrant replacing the cartridge at correspondingly lower
mileages.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to replace the cartridge, care should
be taken to see that a new cover gasket is installed and
that the cover is securely tightened. The cover should
also be checked occasionally to make sure that it remains
tight.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Engine Oil Renewal</b></i> Engine oil should be changed
<i>at least</i> by the end of the first 1000 miles (1609 km.).
After this period the oil should be changed regularly,
the frequency depending on the condition of the oil as
affected by operating and atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>Under average driving conditions oil should be changed
at 2500 to 3000 mile (4023 to 4828 km.) intervals.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Engine Oil Viscosity</b></i> &ldquo;Engine oil viscosity&rdquo; is a
term which indicates, broadly, the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the oil to be
used in your engine, although other scientific considerations
enter into assigning viscosity numbers to oil.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

</div>
<p>Generally speaking, you use a thin oil in winter because
it flows more freely in cold temperatures than a
thick oil. Since, as stated above, the oil in your car&rsquo;s
crankcase, if of good quality, will be useful for many
hundreds of miles, it is impractical to change oil more
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
often than necessary. Therefore, we list below the viscosities
of engine oil recommended for your car at lowest
prevailing temperature generally expected in your
locality during the various seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Most of the higher priced motor oils sold today contain
chemical detergents which hold extremely small
particles of carbon or other foreign matter in suspension.
Many of the particles are so small that they flow through
the oil filters with the oil and remain in suspension. For
this reason, oil which is perfectly good for lubrication
purposes may be discolored when seen on the oil level
gage. With such oils the need for an oil change should
be governed by the mileage the oil has been used and the
dust conditions prevalent during that mileage. As long
as the oil retains a &ldquo;slick&rdquo; quality and good body, it is
generally satisfactory.</p>

<p class="revint">1. Before using jack, set parking brake by depressing
brake pedal and pull outward on parking brake
handle. On steep grades, it may be advisable to
block the front or rear wheels as an extra precaution
against rolling.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Open luggage compartment and unscrew single lug
nut to free spare wheel and tire. Remove jack base,
jack handle, spare wheel and tire, and bumper jack.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Place jack base so that jack lip will contact underside
of bumper at outer edge of the vertical bumper
bar on the flat tire side of the car. Also place base
so that it will be about one inch inward from the
outer edge of the bumper.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Put the jack mechanism lever in the UP position.
Place lip of jack in contact with the underside of
the bumper against the outer edge of the vertical
bumper bar.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Use chisel end of jack handle to remove hub cover.
Then place chisel end of the jack in the jack
mechanism and jack up the car. <span class="sc">Note</span>&mdash;If tire to
be changed is on a front wheel, jack up only a few
notches to be sure jack is secure, then start wheel
lug nuts loose before continuing the jacking up
process. On rear wheels, the parking brake will hold
the wheel so that the nuts can be loosened after the
car has been jacked up.</p>
<p class="revint">6. On wheels on the left side of the car, the wheel lug
nuts are left-hand threaded. To remove them, use
the hexagonal wrench end of the jack handle and
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
turn the nuts clockwise. On wheels on the right side
of the car, the nuts are removed by turning them
counterclockwise. Nuts are installed by turning
them in the direction opposite to that used in removing
them.</p>
<p class="revint">7. Raise car with jack until wheel is free of the road
and can revolve freely. This is important to be sure
you have enough clearance to install spare. Remove
flat tire and wheel and place spare wheel and tire
over studs. Install lug nuts and tighten uniformly
and firmly.</p>
<p class="revint">8. Lower jack by first placing jack mechanism lever
in its DOWN position and work the jack with the
handle in the same manner as when raising car.</p>
<p class="revint">9. Replace tools and spare in this order: Jack shaft
and mechanism go into the holder provided at the
right of the spare wheel well. Jack mechanism must
fit snug against bulge of tire to prevent rattling.
Next install the spare wheel and tire, being sure the
hinged bolt comes through the wheel hub hole. Place
retainer plate over bolt and screw on the retainer
nut. Wedge jack handle and jack base between tire
and well. Put luggage compartment lid handle in
closed position, <i>lock handle and remove key, and
close lid</i>.</p>

distilled water.</p>
<p class="revint">2. The specific gravity of the battery solution.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Battery connections&mdash;should be clean and tight.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Charging Precautions</b></i> It is advisable to observe
the following precautions when charging a battery at
home or elsewhere. During the charging and for a short
time immediately thereafter, the chemical reaction in the
battery gives off hydrogen gas in sufficient quantities as
to be explosive. When working near a battery being
charged, or just after it has been charged, it is important
that no flame or spark have an opportunity to ignite the
hydrogen gas. To prevent possibility of a static electricity
spark&rsquo;s causing such an explosion with the battery in the
car, it is well to ground the car electrically by means of
a metal bar or chain running from the car&rsquo;s frame or
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
bumper to the ground. When the charging or recently
charged battery is out of the car, it should be placed
where it will not be exposed to flame, spark, or static
electricity.</p>
<h3>Minimize Oil Dilution and Sludge</h3>
<p>The crankcase is provided with a cross ventilation
system to reduce harmful dilution of the engine oil by
water and fuel. Crankcase dilution is aggravated by low
speed driving with frequent stops and starts because the
engine does not warm up to the normal operating temperature.
The driver can materially assist in preventing
this condition by observing the following suggestions:</p>
<p class="revint">1. After starting, give the engine time to warm up
before driving.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Keep the engine in good mechanical condition. See
that the compression is good and that the ignition
and carburetion systems are kept in peak condition.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Clean the crankcase at least once a year, preferably
when winter oil is changed for summer weight oil.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Use the proper grade of a reputable engine oil.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Use a good grade of fresh gasoline.</p>
<p class="revint">6. Check thermostat operation.</p>
<p>Operating an engine at subnormal temperatures causes
a much more rapid dilution of the crankcase oil than is
experienced at normal temperatures.</p>
<h3>Rust and Corrosion Inhibitor</h3>
<p>Because of the chemical reaction between metal and
the lime or other minerals in water, one U. S. pint (.833
Imperial pt., 0.47 liters) of an approved inhibitor such as
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Studebaker Cooling System Rust Inhibitor or Resistor
should be added to the cooling system of every new car
and replenished as needed throughout the life of the car.
This will help protect the entire cooling system (radiator,
cylinder block, cylinder head, and water pump) from any
chemical corrosions, rust, or calcification within the radiator
core which may restrict the passages. This does not,
however, dispense with the need of flushing the cooling
system seasonally, spring and fall. Following each draining
a pint of the inhibitor should be used unless it is included
in the new coolant.</p>
<p>Many anti-freeze compounds do contain a rust inhibitor.
Ask your dealer whether the anti-freeze you use
during the winter is of this kind. If so, it will not be necessary
to install a rust inhibitor in the cooling system
while such an anti-freeze is in use.</p>
<div class="box">
<h3 class="center">CAUTION</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Carbon Monoxide</span> <i>is a lethal gas, odorless, tasteless,
and colorless, found in the exhaust fumes of
all engines. Never start the engine in a closed
garage. Always open garage doors wide before
starting the engine and keep the doors open as long
as the engine is operating.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3>Gasoline Economy</h3>
<p>The kind of gasoline you use in your new Studebaker
is an important factor in performance, economy, and
service.</p>
<p>It is important to purchase your gasoline from a dealer
selling the product of a reputable refinery in sufficient
volume to assure fresh, clean gasoline which hasn&rsquo;t accumulated
moisture, dirt and tank settlings from lying
dormant for relatively long periods.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Speed</b></i> Drive at a moderate and constant speed.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Idling</b></i> Shut off the engine while parked, even for a
few minutes, such as waiting for long freight trains at
railroad crossings. Idling, except to warm up a cold engine,
is sheer waste.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Stopping</b></i> Come to a gradual stop whenever possible.
This saves fuel, brake lining, and tires.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Accelerating</b></i> If peak economy is to be obtained,
acceleration must be gradual. Rapid acceleration wastes
gasoline.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Tires</b></i> Keep your tires properly inflated.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Lubrication</b></i> Keep both the engine and chassis well
lubricated at all times. This reduces friction to a minimum.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Mechanical Condition</b></i> Periodic &ldquo;tuning&rdquo; of the
engine by your Studebaker dealer&rsquo;s service department
will insure maximum mechanical efficiency necessary to
good gasoline mileage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h3>Tire Inflation and Care</h3>
<p>Inflate and check tires to recommended pressures given
on <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a> with the tires cold (at atmospheric temperatures),
and not after a long run.</p>
<p>If your tires are checked immediately after a long
run, do not permit the attendant to reduce the pressures
by letting out air. Wait until the tires have had a
chance to cool before checking pressures.</p>
<p>You can ensure more even wear of all tires by having
your Studebaker dealer criss-cross them according to the
latest factory recommendations at approximately 4000
mile (6437 km.) intervals. Have tires and wheels checked
for need of balance after each criss-crossing.</p>
<h3>Ignition Timing</h3>
<p>For economy of fuel consumption and noiseless combustion
relative to the type of gasoline used, the ignition
timing may be advanced or retarded. Such an adjustment
should be made by your Studebaker dealer.</p>
<h3>Carburetor Air Cleaner</h3>
<p>Two types of air cleaner are available for Studebaker
cars. One is the &ldquo;oil wetted&rdquo; type for cars operated a
greater part of the time over pavement and roads which
are comparatively free from dust. The other is known as
the &ldquo;oil bath&rdquo; type and is available at extra cost for cars
operated where dust conditions are severe.</p>
<p>Dust particles, although microscopically small, are
highly abrasive and tend to score and cut the smooth
glasslike surfaces of working parts&mdash;increasing the rate
of wear. The proper type of air cleaner installed on your
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
car, properly maintained
and serviced,
will increase the life
of the engine, and
aid in maintaining
its normal efficiency.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="pcap">OIL WETTED AIR CLEANER</p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>WING NUT</dt>
<dt>FILTER ELEMENT</dt></dl>
<p>Because local conditions
alone determine
the frequency
of air cleaner service,
it will be necessary
to ask your dealer
how often this should be performed.</p>
<h4>TO SERVICE THE OIL WETTED AIR CLEANER</h4>
<p class="revint">1. Remove the filter element, clean with kerosene, and
shake out until dry.</p>
<p class="revint">2. When thoroughly dry submerge in a good grade
of engine oil and allow excess oil to drain before
reinstalling the element in the cleaner.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Replace filter element and wipe off all excess oil.</p>
<h4>TO SERVICE THE OIL BATH AIR CLEANER</h4>
<p class="revint">1. Remove the filter element, clean in kerosene, and
allow to dry thoroughly.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Clean the oil reservoir.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Pour one pint of new engine oil into the reservoir.
S.A.E. 50 for above 32&deg; F. (0&deg; C.) S.A.E. 20 for
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>

<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h3>Anti-Freeze Solutions</h3>
<p>Either the alcohol-base or ethylene-glycol base anti-freeze
is recommended for use in your Studebaker. Be
sure the brand you select contains a rust inhibitor. Do
not use an anti-freeze preparation which contains salt,
sugar, calcium chloride, soda, or petroleum base compounds.</p>
<p>Reputable anti-freeze companies supply their dealers
with charts showing the amount of anti-freeze to use for
protection to various anticipated temperatures, depending
upon cooling system capacity given on <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>.</p>
<h3>Care of Car Finish</h3>
<p>The high luster, hard-baked enamel finish of your new
Studebaker is best retained by an application of approved
Studebaker Cleaner and Polish or Cleaner and Wax after
each washing. The enamel, however, should not be
subjected to an application of wax of any kind during
the first 60 days so that sufficient time may be provided
for the finish to become fully hardened.</p>
<p>Approved Studebaker appearance maintenance materials
are available from your Studebaker dealer. These
are recommended to remove the accumulation of road
scum and dullness resulting from weather or road conditions
and to restore the luster of the enamel finish. Do
not become alarmed when polishing or waxing if a slight
amount of color appears on the cloth. This is a natural
condition.</p>
<p>Alcohol, anti-freeze mixtures containing alcohol, and
calcium chloride or other chemical mixtures used to melt
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
snow and ice or to settle dust should be flushed with
water as soon as possible in order to avoid damage to
the enamel finish and chromium parts.</p>
<h3>Washing the Car</h3>
<p>When washing the car, first saturate all foreign substances
on the finish with cold water. Then use a clean
sponge and running water for the removal of dirt. Dry
the body with a clean, damp chamois skin, using a
straight horizontal or vertical motion, rather than a circular
motion. It is important that a different sponge and
chamois skin be used on the body from that used on the
chassis.</p>
<p>Chromium and nickel plated finishes are of a perishable
nature and will deteriorate if not properly cared for.
These parts should be kept clean and free from dirt and
foreign matter. To clean chromium plated parts, use clear
water and a clean cloth. To protect the finish after the
parts are cleaned, apply a coating of paste-type body wax.
<i>For further details on chrome plated parts, see the card
placed in the package compartment.</i></p>
<h3>Care of Cloth Upholstery</h3>
<p>Clean upholstery means not only a better looking automobile
but gives longer wear and affords greater comfort
and enjoyment.</p>
<p>The use of a vacuum cleaner and a thorough brushing
of the upholstery and headlining (with the nap or pile)
will usually brighten the interior noticeably. Remove the
cushions from the car and brush to remove foreign particles
from the fabric.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Studebaker Fabric Cleaner (available through Studebaker
dealers) is effective in removing all types of stains
and does not harm the upholstery.</p>
<p>Seat and side upholstery can be washed safely with
soap and water. Use lukewarm water and a neutral soap.
The suds should be good and frothy, not watery. Apply
in moderate quantities with a damp cloth, sponge, or soft
brush. Remove soap suds with a clean, damp cloth or
sponge, then wipe the surface several times with a dry
cloth. While the material is still damp, brush it lightly
with a whisk broom or brush of medium stiffness. Permit
air to circulate freely over the wet upholstery. When
dry, brush again to loosen any minute matting. When
brushing, always brush fabric with the lay of the pile
or nap.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Leather Upholstery</h3>
<p>Leather upholstery may be cleaned with a soft sponge
and saddle soap. Make a light suds with lukewarm water
and saddle soap. This type of soap is especially suitable
for cleaning leather and leaves the surface soft and
pliable.</p>
<p>Rinse the sponge occasionally in clean water. After
completing the cleaning operation, use a clean, soft
cloth to polish the surface of the leather.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Rubber Parts</h3>
<p>Studebaker Chromium Cleaner (powder type AC-1464)
is recommended for cleaning white sidewall tires.
Studebaker Black Rubber Finish is recommended for
black tires and all black rubber parts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h3>Care of the Convertible Fabric Top</h3>
<p>The life of any convertible top can be materially
lengthened if care is taken to <i>lower the top only when
it is dry. Never operate the top motor when the car is
in motion.</i></p>
<p>Tops used on Studebaker convertible models are made
of a two-ply material. The face of the black top is made
of cotton and rayon. The face of the light-colored tops
used on some Studebaker convertible models is made of
<i>Orlon</i><a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> acrylic fiber and will not shrink, mildew, or
stretch as a result of exposure to the elements. These
facing materials are bound to a cotton backing material.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Cleaning</b></i> Traffic grime and most other soiling may
be removed by washing the top with a sudsy mixture of
mild (neutral) soap and warm water. A soft brush may
be used if necessary. Strong solvents, naphtha, or carbon
tetrachloride are not recommended for cleaning this
fabric.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Rear Windows</b></i> of convertible tops are made of a
clear plastic material. They should not be wiped while
dry since the abrasive particles in the dust will tend to
scratch the surface of the plastic. Clean the convertible
top rear window by flooding it with cold water and
wiping off the dirt with a soft cloth or sponge during
the flooding process.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">SERVICE AND ADJUSTMENTS</span></h2>
<h3>Engine Tune-Up</h3>
<p>Occasionally your serviceman will recommend an engine
tune-up. The frequency of tune-ups depends almost
entirely on the amount of driving and the type of driving
you do. When you purchase a tune-up, we recommend
that you request at least the following operations:</p>
<p class="revint">1. Check the manifold heater valve for free operation.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Clean and adjust spark plugs; install with new gaskets.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Clean carburetor air cleaner.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Clean fuel pump bowl and strainer; install with
new gasket.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Clean inside of distributor cover, cable terminals,
and sockets.</p>
<p class="revint">6. Tighten cylinder head cap screws to recommended
tension.</p>
<p class="revint">7. Adjust fan belt.</p>
<p class="revint">8. Remove and clean carburetor choke thermostatic
control. Replace with new gasket and adjust, if
necessary.</p>
<p class="revint">9. Check and set ignition timing.</p>
<p class="revint">10. Adjust carburetor idle screw with engine at normal
operating temperatures.</p>
<p class="revint">11. Adjust idle stop screw to produce engine speed
corresponding with 8 miles (13 km.) per hour road
speed in high gear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3>Adjustments and Other Service</h3>
<p><i><b>Carburetor Adjustment for High Altitude</b></i> The
carburetor is carefully calibrated to provide efficient operation.
Studebaker dealers are acquainted with the adjustments
which are needed for high altitude operation.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Brake Adjustment</b></i> The self-adjusting brakes on
your car are self-compensating for lining wear and require
no adjustment. They are properly set at the factory.</p>
<p>With each application of the brakes, however, the linings
wear and, after a time, new linings should be installed
to provide the maximum braking area and to
avoid damage to the brake drums. When the lining needs
replacement, the self-adjusting feature ceases to operate.
When this occurs, the brake pedal free travel will increase
and the driver is warned that the brakes need relining.
If your brakes do not operate satisfactorily, see
your Studebaker dealer.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Clutch Pedal Travel Adjustment</b></i> Clutch pedal
free travel is the distance the pedal moves forward before
resistance of the release mechanism is felt. When the
free travel is greater than one inch (25,4 mm.) or less
than one-half inch (12,7 mm.) adjustment should be
made by your Studebaker dealer.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>The Hill Holder</b></i> (on cars so equipped) should be
checked and adjusted if necessary whenever the clutch
pedal travel is adjusted.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Fan Belt Adjustment</b></i> To insure efficient fan, water
pump and generator operation, it is important that the
fan belt is not over-tightened. Any readjustment should
be performed by a Studebaker dealer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Front Wheel Camber Adjustment</b></i> Camber adjustment
is properly set at the factory &frac12;&deg; greater on
the driver&rsquo;s side of the car than on the other side. Should
a front end alignment check reveal need of camber readjustment,
it should be set as nearly to &frac34;&deg; on driver&rsquo;s
side and &frac14;&deg; on the other side as possible. In any setting,
the driver&rsquo;s side camber should be &frac12;&deg; more than
the other side.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b>Body Drain Holes</b></i> All drain holes should be kept
open to prevent accumulation of water.</p>
<p>The door drain holes are easily cleared with a pen-knife
or other flat instrument which can be inserted in
the holes and run back and forth a few times to loosen
any congestion.</p>
<p>Body drain holes should be cleaned by the serviceman.</p>

with transportation charges prepaid and which our examination
shall disclose to our satisfaction to have been thus defective; this
warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties, express or

any commercial motor vehicle sold by us which shall have been
operated at a speed exceeding the factory rated speed, or loaded
beyond the factory rated load capacity.</p>
